# autograder-analyzer
Utility to help analyze failed autograder tests

**Important: Due to insertion/deletion, the program will only detect one error per run.
If there is multiple errors, they will only be detected if the prior has been resolved.**


To copy an entire line of a failed autograder test easily, follow the steps below:
  1. Place your cursor just before the first character in the line of text
  2. Hold down left-click
  3. Drag down slowly until you see the line of text hihglight blue
  4. Copy
  5. Paste into terminal by either right-clicking, or Crtl + Shift + V on Windows.
  
After pasting in your failed test text, press enter to continue the program.
The analyzer should print two 10 character snapshots, showing both the expected result
and the result generated by your program. 

The snapshots will be centered around the mismatched characters unless the mismatch occurs 
within the last 5 characters of your program's output. In that case, the snapshots will be 
truncated at the end of your program's output. In the case that the mismatch occurs within 
the first 5 characters of your program's output, the snapshots should remain 10 characters
in length, using spaces to shift your program's output to the right.
